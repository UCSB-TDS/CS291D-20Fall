\section{Recap of Previous Discussions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Layer 1: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Consensus.
	\item Smart contracts.
	\end{itemize}
\item Layer 2:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Oracles.
	\end{itemize}
\item Universal verifiability: all data is public.
\item Assets are controlled by signatures. Secret keys can be thought of as specialized zero-knowledge proof systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction to zk-SNARKs}
\begin{itemize}
\item The main benefit of zk-SNARKs is privacy. zk-SNARKs allow us to encrypt public data on blockchains.
\item Toy example: we move from state \texttt{i} to state \texttt{i+1} on the blockchain using the transaction $T$. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item We encrypt \texttt{i}, \texttt{i+1} and $T$.
	\item We wish to verify that $T$ is a sound transaction for state \texttt{i} and that it produces state \texttt{i+1}. 
	\item This verification should take the form of a zero-knowledge proof $\Pi$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction to Circuits}
\begin{itemize}
\item Boolean circuits are composed using the binary operators AND, OR and NOT.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item AND$(x, y) = x\cdot y$
	\item OR$(x, y) = x+y-x\cdot y$
	\item NOT$(x) = 1-x$ 
	\item We can represent any boolean function as a circuit $C: \{0,1\}^N \longrightarrow \{0,1\}$.
	\end{itemize}
\item Arithmetic circuits are mappings $C: F_p^N \longrightarrow F_p$, where $F_p$ is a finite field.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Intuitively, finite fields are finite sets of objects with certain operations defined on them.
	\item For example, there is an addition operation. A property of finite fields is that
		\begin{equation}
		a, b \in F_p \implies a+b \in F_p.
		\end{equation}
	\item Arithmetic circuits can be represented using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
	\item You can express boolean circuits as arithmetic circuits (but it may be inefficient to do so).
	\end{itemize}
\item The link between circuits and hash functions is as follows. Imagine that we have a circuit
	\begin{equation}
	C_{\text{hash}}: (h, m) \longrightarrow \{0,1\},
	\end{equation}
	which is zero if $h=H(m)$ and unity otherwise, where $H$ is a hash function (e.g. SHA256).
\end{itemize}

\section{Milestones in the History of Proof Systems}
\begin{itemize}
\item In 1992, it was proven that the complexity class IP is equivalent to the class PSPACE (Fortnow, Karloff, Nisan, Shamir).
\item The PCP theorem was proven (Arora, Lund, Safra, Sudan). Idea: any NP statement (anything expressible in a circuit) has a probabilistically checkable proof such that this proof can be verified in polynomial time relative to the size of the classic proof.
\item Developments in non-interactive proof systems (Kilian, Micali, Groth).
\end{itemize}

\section{Illustration of a Scheme for Zero-Knowledge Proofs}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this scenario, we have a prover (Alice) and a verifier (Bob).
\item Imagine that there are two finite field elements $x\in F_p^n$ and $w \in F_p^m$.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $x$ is public, while $w$ (the witness) is private (known only to Alice).
	\end{itemize}
\item Alice uses $x$ and $w$ to compute the arithmetic circuit $C(x, w) \in F_p$.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The circuit $C$ is public.
	\item Note that $C$ could be a representation of a boolean circuit. We will assume that it evaluates to \texttt{true}.
	\end{itemize}
\item Alice wishes to prove the following to Bob:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Soundness: there exists a $w$ such that $C(x, w)$ evaluates to \texttt{true}.
	\item Knowledge: Alice knows the $w$ in question.
	\end{itemize}
\item Why can't Alice just send $w$ to Bob? Three reasons:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $w$ needs to be private.
	\item $w$ may be too long to send.
	\item $C(x, w)$ may be inefficient to compute.
	\end{itemize}
\item Instead of sending $w$, Alice will send a zero-knowledge proof $\Pi$. This will be constructed as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The key elements of the construction are mappings $S$, $P$ and $V$. $S$ is used to generate keys, while $P$ and $V$ are used for proving and verifying respectively.
	\item First, we act $S$ on the circuit $C$ to obtain a pair of keys, $p_k$ (proving key) and $v_k$ (verification key).
	\item Alice computes $P(p_k, x, w)$ to obtain a proof $\Pi$.
	\item Bob computes $V(v_k, x, \Pi)$ to obtain either \texttt{true} (if the proof was correct) or \texttt{false}.
	\item In order for this scheme to be successful, we require that
		\begin{equation}
		V(v_k, x, \Pi) = \texttt{true} \implies V(v_k, x, P(p_k, x, w)) = \texttt{true},
		\end{equation}
		as well as the fact that $V(v_k, x, \Pi) = \texttt{true} \implies$ Alice knows $w$ such that $C(x, w)$ is \texttt{true}.
	\item This proof is zero-knowledge: $\Pi$ and $x$ reveal nothing about $w$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
