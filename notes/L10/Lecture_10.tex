% This is a borrowed LaTeX template file for lecture notes for CS267,
% Applications of Parallel Computing, UCBerkeley EECS Department.
% Now being used for CMU's 10725 Fall 2012 Optimization course
% taught by Geoff Gordon and Ryan Tibshirani.  When preparing 
% LaTeX notes for this class, please use this template.
%
% To familiarize yourself with this template, the body contains
% some examples of its use.  Look them over.  Then you can
% run LaTeX on this file.  After you have LaTeXed this file then
% you can look over the result either by printing it out with
% dvips or using xdvi. "pdflatex template.tex" should also work.

\section{Some theorems and stuff} % Don't be this informal in your notes!

We now delve right into the proof.

\begin{lemma}
This is the first lemma of the lecture.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on $\ldots$.
For fun, we throw in a figure.
%%%NOTE USAGE !
\fig{1}{1in}{A Fun Figure}

This is the end of the proof, which is marked with a little box.
\end{proof}

\subsection{A few items of note}

Here is an itemized list:
\begin{itemize}
\item this is the first item;
\item this is the second item.
\end{itemize}

Here is an enumerated list:
\begin{enumerate}
\item this is the first item;
\item this is the second item.
\end{enumerate}

Here is an exercise:

{\bf Exercise:}  Show that ${\rm P}\ne{\rm NP}$.

Here is how to define things in the proper mathematical style.
Let $f_k$ be the $AND-OR$ function, defined by

\[ f_k(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2^k}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}

	x_1 & \mbox{if $k = 0$;} \\

	AND(f_{k-1}(x_1, \ldots, x_{2^{k-1}}),
	   f_{k-1}(x_{2^{k-1} + 1}, \ldots, x_{2^k}))
	 & \mbox{if $k$ is even;} \\

	OR(f_{k-1}(x_1, \ldots, x_{2^{k-1}}),
	   f_{k-1}(x_{2^{k-1} + 1}, \ldots, x_{2^k}))	
	& \mbox{otherwise.} 
	\end{array}
	\right. \]

\begin{theorem}
This is the first theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This is the proof of the first theorem. We show how to write pseudo-code now.
%*** USE PSEUDO-CODE ONLY IF IT IS CLEARER THAN AN ENGLISH DESCRIPTION

Consider a comparison between $x$ and~$y$:
\begin{tabbing}
\hspace*{.25in} \= \hspace*{.25in} \= \hspace*{.25in} \= \hspace*{.25in} \= \hspace*{.25in} \=\kill
\>{\bf if} $x$ or $y$ or both are in $S$ {\bf then } \\
\>\> answer accordingly \\
\>{\bf else} \\
\>\>    Make the element with the larger score (say $x$) win the comparison \\
\>\> {\bf if} $F(x) + F(y) < \frac{n}{t-1}$ {\bf then} \\%
\>\>\> $F(x) \leftarrow F(x) + F(y)$ \\
\>\>\> $F(y) \leftarrow 0$ \\
\>\> {\bf else}  \\
\>\>\> $S \leftarrow S \cup \{ x \} $ \\
\>\>\> $r \leftarrow r+1$ \\
\>\> {\bf endif} \\
\>{\bf endif} 
\end{tabbing}

This concludes the proof.
\end{proof}
